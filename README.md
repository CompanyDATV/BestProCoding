## Q&A ==> (Question and Answer)
* For a Visual Studio Code/Atom developer that works mostly with Node.js/TypeScript/Ruby/Go and wants to get rid of graphic-text-editors-IDE-like at once, which one is worthy of investing time to pick up?

* I'm a total noob on the subject, but I've read good things about Neovim's Lua support, and I wonder what would be the VIM response/approach for it?<br>

===> Answer!!! <br>
* Neovim can basically do everything Vim can with one major advantage - the number of contributors to the code base is just so much wider (Vim is ~100% maintained only by B. Mooleanaar). Whatever you learn for Neovim you can also apply to Vim and vice versa. And of course there is the never ending Vim vs Emacs controversy - but better not get into that war (Về cơ bản Neovim có thể làm mọi thứ mà Vim có thể làm được với một lợi thế chính - số lượng người đóng góp cho cơ sở mã rộng hơn rất nhiều (Vim chỉ được duy trì bởi B. Mooleanaar là ~ 100%). Bất cứ điều gì bạn học cho Neovim, bạn cũng có thể áp dụng cho Vim và ngược lại. Và tất nhiên có cuộc tranh cãi không bao giờ kết thúc giữa Vim và Emacs - nhưng tốt hơn là đừng tham gia vào cuộc chiến đó)
